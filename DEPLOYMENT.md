# Deployment

This project uses Google Cloud Build to build, test, and deploy the backend to Cloud Run.

## Environment Variables

Add the following variables when configuring the Cloud Build trigger. They are passed to the Cloud Run service during deployment:

- `PROJECT_ID`: Google Cloud project identifier where resources are deployed.
- `_SERVICE_NAME`: Cloud Run service name. For this project the service name is `learning-hub`.
- `_REGION`: Cloud Run region (for example `us-central1`).
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: OAuth client ID used to verify incoming ID tokens.
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Client secret paired with the OAuth client ID.
- `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`: Redirect URI configured for the OAuth client.
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`: JSON service account credentials for Firestore.

## Manual Deployment

To build and deploy the backend manually run:

```bash
gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild.yaml \
  --substitutions _SERVICE_NAME=$SERVICE_NAME,_REGION=$REGION,PROJECT_ID=$PROJECT_ID,\
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=$GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=$GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI,FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
```

## Cloud Build Trigger

Create a trigger in the Google Cloud console so that pushes to the `main` branch execute the pipeline:

1. Open **Cloud Build â†’ Triggers** and click **Create trigger**.
2. Choose this repository and set the event to **Push to a branch** with the branch pattern `main`.
3. Use `cloudbuild.yaml` as the build configuration file.
4. Supply the substitutions and environment variables listed above.

See the [Cloud Build trigger documentation](https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/automate-builds/github/create-github-app-triggers) for more details.
